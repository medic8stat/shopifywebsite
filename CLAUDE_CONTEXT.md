## 10. Patient Journey & System Boundaries

### Entry Points (Website → EHR)

Patients enter the EHR system via one of these paths:

```
PATH 1: Direct Purchase (Self-Service)
───────────────────────────────────────
Website → View Services → Purchase Package → Entra ID Signup (automated) → Patient Portal

PATH 2: Concierge Discovery Call ($300)
───────────────────────────────────────
Website → Contact → Book Discovery Call → Pay $300 → Phone Consultation →
  └─ If enrolling: Purchase Package → Entra ID Signup → Patient Portal
  └─ If not enrolling: End

PATH 3: Manual Enrollment (Clinic Staff)
───────────────────────────────────────
Patient contacts clinic → Staff creates account in EHR → Patient receives portal invite
```

### System Responsibilities

| System | Responsibility | What Happens Here |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Website (Shopify)** | Marketing & Sales | Service discovery, education, payment processing |
| **Patient Portal** | Patient Self-Service | Questionnaires, results viewing, form downloads, educational materials |
| **EHR (Clinician App)** | Clinical Workflow | Patient records, assessments, clinical documentation |

### The Needs Assessment

**Purpose:** Understand the patient holistically before the consultation
- Medical goals and health concerns
- Life goals (6 months, 1 year, 5 years)
- What age they're comfortable living to
- Major life goals they want to achieve

**When:** After enrollment, before clinical visit
**How:**
- Sent as email link, OR
- Completed in Patient Portal after login
- Can be done by phone for accessibility

**Why:** Maximize clinician time and consultation thoroughness by gathering information upfront.

### Patient Portal Features (Current & Future)

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Online Questionnaires | ✅ Current | Needs assessment, health history forms |
| Results Viewing | ✅ Current | View assessment results |
| Form Downloads | ✅ Current | Lab requisitions, referral forms |
| Educational Materials | 🔜 Planned | Health education content |
| AI Health Assistant | 🔜 Future | Canadian-hosted LLM for health questions |
