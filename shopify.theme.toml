# =================================================
# This file configures the Shopify CLI for safe theme development.
#
# CRITICAL RULES:
# - NEVER push to production theme (TS Media Design #178766348583)
# - ALWAYS use the broadcast environment for development

[environments.broadcast]
# Development/Staging theme - SAFE TO PUSH
store = "whitepinemedical.myshopify.com"
theme = "182960718119"
# No ignore rules - Claude Code is the source of truth for all files

[environments.production]
# DANGER: Live theme - DO NOT USE FOR DEVELOPMENT
# This is here only for reference - NEVER push to this theme
store = "whitepinemedical.myshopify.com"
theme = "178766348583"
